## Requirements

As a minimum, you will need a MoneyLoop API Key.
Please [contact us](mailto:hello@moneyloop.com.au) to obtain a key.

Furthermore, there may be component-specific requirements needed to render properly.
For more information on component-specific requirements, see [components](/components).

## Installation

To install, download the script and css files into your `html` page:

```html
<script src="https://moneyloop.com.au/api/applicationform.js"></script>
```

If you want styling (**recommended**), also download our stylesheet:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://moneyloop.com.au/api/applicationform.css"
/>
```

You can overwrite our styling by including your own stylesheet underneath our own:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://moneyloop.com.au/api/applicationform.css"
/>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" />
```

You are now able to use our components and API!
